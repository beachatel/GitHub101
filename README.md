<h1> How to use Git and GitHub </h1>

<h2> Why do I keep yapping about GitHub???</h2> <br>

<h3> GitHub is great for 3 reasons: <h3>

1. You can store huge amounts of code on the cloud, for free. This allows you to access your code from any machine in the world with an internet connection. <br>

2. You can track changes in your code, this allows you to version control. Meaning you can revert back to a specific point in your code when something worked/didn't work. This is especially great when you have lots of different itterations of something and you might want to document the process. <br>

3. Collaboration. For large projects with multiple people, GitHub is the perfect way to collab on code. You can make requests to change something, submit issues and coordinate across the project.<br>

4. Open Source. There are more than 28 million public repositories on GitHub that allow you to view, download and edit their contents. Think of all the learning :nerd_face:.

<h2> Tutorial </h2>

<h3> Step 1, install Git </h3>

Go to https://git-scm.com/install/ and install for your operating system.
<br><br> (Note - Git is a free and open source distributed version control system, GitHub is the platform that uses Git.)

<h3> Step 2, Create a GitHub repository</h3>

Go to https://github.com, sign in if prompted. Then navigate to the repositories tab and click create a new repository.

You should be on a page that looks like this: <br>

Once you have named your repo hit create repository at the bottom of the page. You should then be taken to a page that looks like this: <br>

<h3> Step 3, Link your local folder to GitHub </h3>
