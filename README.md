<h1> How to use GitHub </h1>

<h2> Why do I keep yapping about GitHub???</h2> <br>

<p> GitHub is great for 3 reasons: <br>

1. You can store huge amounts of code on the cloud, for free. This allows you to access your code from any machine in the world with an internet connection. <br>

2. You can track changes in your code, this allows you to version control. Meaning you can revert back to a specific point in your code when something worked/didn't work. This is especially great when you have lots of different itterations of something and you might want to document the process. <br>

3. Collaboration. For large projects with multiple people, GitHub is the perfect way to collab on code. You can make requests to change something, submit issues and coordinate across the project.<br>

4. Open Source. There are more than 28 million public repositories on GitHub that allow you to view, download and edit their contents. Think of all the learning :nerd_face:.
